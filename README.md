> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a work-in-progress and not the finished product.
> Librarian will be constantly updated and is not yet ready for its first release. But soon it will be.

> The librarian is the torchbearer, inheriting the legacy of the next library's vision, nurturing its spirit, and guiding its evolution into the future.
